# Combining-Two-PreTrained-Models

The above file consists of a Jupyter notebook file which contains a model obtained by combining the results of two pre-trained models. The results of mobilenet and vgg16 were combined to predict the output. This was tested with the help of chest x-ray dataset to evaluate the model and test it's performance. The pre-trained models were fine-tuned with the chest x-ray images before testing them.
